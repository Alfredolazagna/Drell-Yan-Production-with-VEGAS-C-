 # VEGAS-C
The code is run simply by running each cell in order. Make sure to wait for each to finish running before moving onto the next. Our own attempt at the VEGAS algorithm is at the last cell. To run it, simply run that cell to initialize it, and then in the Vegas function change the call to the setup intervals function to the setup_intervals_our_attempt.
